# Password Strength Validator

Ensure your passwords are secure with this intuitive, real-time password strength checker. This simple yet powerful web application evaluates your password’s strength as you type, offering clear feedback and guidance on how to create strong, secure passwords to protect your online accounts.

## Key Features

- **Real-time password validation**: Instantly checks your password as you type, providing immediate feedback on:
  - Minimum password length of 12 characters
  - Inclusion of at least one lowercase letter
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - Inclusion of at least one number
  - At least one special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`)
- **Instant feedback**: Color-coded indicators guide you through the validation process, turning green for valid and red for unmet criteria, helping you understand password strength instantly.
- **Submit button activation**: The "Submit" button is enabled only when all password requirements are met, ensuring you create a secure password before submitting.
